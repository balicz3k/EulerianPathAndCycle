# EulerianPathAndCycle
The project focuses on solving the problems of finding paths and Euler cycles in a graph. It aims to develop an algorithm specifically designed for efficiently identifying the shortest paths and detecting Euler cycles within a given graph structure.

The algorithm will take into account the connectivity between vertices and utilize appropriate graph traversal techniques to search for paths. It will identify the optimal route by considering factors such as edge weights or costs associated with traversing each edge. In addition, it will detect Euler cycles by examining the graph's connectivity and determining if a cycle exists that visits each edge exactly once.

The project will provide a user-friendly interface where users can input the graph data and specify the source and destination vertices for path finding. The results will be displayed, showcasing the shortest path or informing the user about the presence of an Euler cycle within the graph.

By successfully implementing the algorithm, the project will provide a valuable tool for solving real-world problems related to navigation, network routing, or logistical planning. It will contribute to the field of graph theory and provide an efficient solution for finding paths and Euler cycles in diverse graph structures.
